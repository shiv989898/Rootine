# ðŸ”¥ URGENT: Deploy Firestore Rules to Fix Signup Issue

## Problem
Your app is creating accounts in Firebase Authentication, but failing to create user profiles in Firestore because **Firestore security rules are blocking the writes**.

## Solution: Deploy Rules via Firebase Console

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
1. Go to: **https://console.firebase.google.com/**
2. Click on your project: **Rootine** (rootine-d5bef)

### Step 2: Navigate to Firestore Rules
1. In the left sidebar, click **"Firestore Database"**
2. Click the **"Rules"** tab at the top

### Step 3: Copy the Rules
1. Open the file: `DEPLOY_THESE_RULES.txt` in this folder
2. **Select all** the text (Ctrl+A)
3. **Copy it** (Ctrl+C)

### Step 4: Paste and Publish
1. In the Firebase Console Rules editor, **select all existing rules** (Ctrl+A)
2. **Paste** the new rules (Ctrl+V)
3. Click the **"Publish"** button (blue button in the top right)
4. Wait for the success message

### Step 5: Test Signup
1. **Close your Expo app completely** and restart it
2. Try signing up with a **NEW email address** (not one you used before)
3. The signup should now work! âœ…

## Alternative: Clean Up Old Accounts (Optional)

If you want to test with an email you already used:

1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ **Authentication** â†’ **Users**
2. Find the test accounts that failed to create profiles
3. Click the **three dots** (â‹®) next to each account
4. Click **"Delete account"**
5. Now you can sign up with that email again

---

## Why This Happened

- Firebase Authentication creates accounts immediately
- But Firestore document creation was blocked by security rules
- This created "orphaned" accounts (Auth exists, but no Firestore profile)
- The code changes I made will now:
  - âœ… Show clear error messages
  - âœ… Automatically delete Auth accounts if Firestore fails
  - âœ… Prevent orphaned accounts in the future

---

## After Deployment

Once you publish the rules, you should be able to:
- âœ… Sign up new accounts successfully
- âœ… Sign in with those accounts
- âœ… Complete profile setup
- âœ… Use all app features (Habits, Diet, etc.)
