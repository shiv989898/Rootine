## ✅ What I Just Completed

### 1. **Fixed Firebase SDK Compatibility** ✨
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Time:** ~15 minutes

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Uninstalled `@react-native-firebase` packages (native modules)
- ✅ Installed `firebase` web SDK (66 packages)
- ✅ Created `src/config/firebase.ts` configuration
- ✅ Completely rewrote `habitService.ts` with web Firebase SDK
  - All 11 functions updated
  - Proper TypeScript types with `QueryDocumentSnapshot<DocumentData>`
  - Timestamp handling for dates
  - `writeBatch` for bulk operations
- ✅ Zero compilation errors

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD (doesn't work with Expo):
import firestore from '@react-native-firebase/firestore';
const habitsCollection = firestore().collection('habits');

// NEW (works with Expo):
import { collection, getDocs, query, where } from 'firebase/firestore';
const q = query(collection(db, 'habits'), where('userId', '==', userId));
```

**Impact:** 🎯 **CRITICAL FIX**  
- Firebase now works with Expo Go  
- No need for Expo Development Build  
- All habit features functional
