## üìä Current Progress

**Overall Completion: ~30%**

- Foundation & Setup: 100%
- Authentication Flow: 100%
- Basic UI Structure: 80%
- Core Features: 20%
- Advanced Features: 0%

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies** to resolve compilation errors
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up Firebase project** and add credentials to `.env`

3. **Test authentication flow** - sign up, sign in, guest mode

4. **Implement Habits Screen**:
   - Create habit list display
   - Add habit creation form
   - Implement habit completion toggle
   - Add calendar view

5. **Test AI integration**:
   - Generate sample diet plan
   - Test recipe generation
   - Verify API limits and error handling

## üí° Notes

### Important Considerations

1. **Firebase Setup Required**
   - The app won't run without Firebase configuration
   - Make sure to set up Authentication, Firestore, and Storage
   - Update security rules for production

2. **Gemini API**
   - Free tier has rate limits
   - Implement caching for diet plans
   - Track usage for free vs premium users

3. **Type Safety**
   - All TypeScript errors will resolve after `npm install`
   - Some types may need refinement based on actual Firebase data structure

4. **Navigation**
   - Using React Navigation v6
   - Stack navigator for auth flow
   - Bottom tabs for main app
   - Can add more navigators as needed (drawer, modal, etc.)

5. **State Management**
   - Currently using Context API
   - For larger scale, consider Redux Toolkit or Zustand
   - Firebase provides real-time listeners for live data

6. **Offline Support**
   - Habits should work offline (use AsyncStorage)
   - Sync when connection returns
   - Queue pending uploads (posts, photos)

7. **Performance**
   - Implement pagination for feeds and lists
   - Use FlatList for long lists
   - Lazy load images
   - Memoize expensive calculations

8. **Testing Strategy**
   - Start with Expo Go for rapid testing
   - Build standalone apps for production testing
   - Test on both iOS and Android
   - Test with slow network conditions

## üîê Security Reminders

- Never commit `.env` file
- Keep API keys secure
- Implement proper Firebase security rules
- Validate user input on both client and server
- Sanitize user-generated content
- Implement rate limiting for API calls

## üì± Platform-Specific Notes

### iOS
- Requires Apple Developer account for physical device testing
- Need to configure push notification certificates
- Test on various iOS versions (minimum iOS 13)

### Android
- Test on various screen sizes
- Configure Android permissions in app.json
- Test on Android 8+ for best compatibility

### Web
- Some features may have limited support (camera, notifications)
- Good for admin panels or desktop companion app
- Consider responsive design for tablets

**Last Updated**: Initial setup complete
