## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Architecture
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Keeps business logic separate from UI
- **Atomic Operations**: Critical for point/level updates
- **Error Boundaries**: Prevent one system failure from breaking others
- **Type Safety**: Caught Badge.title vs Badge.name bug early

### UX Design
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coding makes data scannable
- **Feedback Timing**: 1.5s animations feel snappy, not slow
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show top 3 badges, hide rest until user wants more
- **Rarity Psychology**: Gold badges feel more valuable than gray

### Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load badges when ProfileScreen opens
- **Pagination**: Leaderboard loads 20 at a time
- **Caching**: User stats cached in context
- **Optimistic UI**: Show animation before database confirms
