## üêõ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Diet Plan System - FIXED

#### Issues Found:
- ‚ùå Diet plan not working
- ‚ùå Only showed single type of diet
- ‚ùå No variety on refresh (same meals every time)
- ‚ùå No meal type selection (breakfast/lunch/dinner)
- ‚ùå No diet type options (vegetarian/non-veg/vegan)

#### Solutions Implemented:
- ‚úÖ **Complete Diet Screen Redesign** (`DietScreen.tsx`)
  - Added meal type filter chips (All, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks)
  - Added diet type selection modal (Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, Vegan, Pescatarian)
  - Added variety seed system - each refresh generates DIFFERENT meals
  - Added visual filters UI with active state indicators
  - Added meal type icons and better card layout

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Gemini AI Service** (`geminiService.ts`)
  - Updated `generateDietPlan()` to accept diet type parameter
  - Updated to accept meal type filter (all/breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks)
  - Added seed parameter for variety - ensures different results on refresh
  - Added diet type specific prompts (veg/non-veg/vegan/pescatarian)
  - AI now provides 2-3 variations when filtering specific meal type

#### New Features:
1. **Filter Modal** - Tap filter icon to customize:
   - Diet Type: Vegetarian | Non-Vegetarian | Vegan | Pescatarian
   - Meal Type: All | Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner | Snacks
   
2. **Meal Type Chips** - Quick filter at top of screen

3. **Variety System** - Pull to refresh generates NEW meals every time

4. **Better UX**:
   - Shows current diet type below date
   - Macros displayed prominently
   - Each meal shows: Name, Description, Calories, Macros
   - Tap meal card to view full recipe

### 2. ‚úÖ XP System - FIXED

#### Issues Found:
- ‚ùå XP going negative
- ‚ùå Only one XP gain per habit (couldn't earn more)
- ‚ùå Level calculation errors

#### Solutions Implemented:

**File: `userService.ts`**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
await updateDoc(userRef, {
  'profile.points': increment(points), // Could go negative!
});

// AFTER (FIXED):
// Get current points first
const currentPoints = userData.profile.points || 0;

// Prevent negative points
if (points < 0 && currentPoints + points < 0) {
  await updateDoc(userRef, {
    'profile.points': 0, // Set to 0 instead of negative
  });
  return 0;
}

// Otherwise, normal increment
await updateDoc(userRef, {
  'profile.points': increment(points),
});

// Auto-update level after points change
await updateUserLevel();
```

**File: `habitService.ts`**
```typescript
// BEFORE (LIMITED):
// Only awarded points once per habit

// AFTER (FIXED):
// EVERY habit completion awards points
// Can complete same habit multiple times per day
// Each completion = +10 XP
// Each un-completion = -10 XP (but never goes below 0)
```

#### Key Improvements:
1. **Never Negative**: Points can never go below 0
2. **Multiple Completions**: Can earn XP from same habit multiple times
3. **Auto Level Update**: Level updates automatically with points
4. **Safe Deduction**: Uncompleting habit safely deducts points
