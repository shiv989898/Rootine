## üìù Update README After Upload

After uploading, don't forget to update the README with your actual GitHub username:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on `README.md`
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
4. Replace these placeholders:
   - `YOUR_USERNAME` ‚Üí Your actual GitHub username
   - `your.email@example.com` ‚Üí Your email
   - `@YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` ‚Üí Your GitHub handle

Or update locally and push again:

# Edit README.md and replace placeholders
# Then commit and push:
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: Update README with actual GitHub info"
git push
```

## üîí IMPORTANT: Protect Your Secrets

**NEVER commit your `.env` file to GitHub!**

Your `.env` file contains sensitive API keys and is already in `.gitignore`. 

To verify it's not being tracked:
```powershell
git status
```

If you see `.env` listed, remove it:
```powershell
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Remove .env from tracking"
git push
```

---

Before making your repository public:
- [ ] Removed all sensitive data from code
- [ ] `.env` file is NOT tracked by git
- [ ] Updated README with your details
- [ ] Tested that clone + setup instructions work
- [ ] Added repository description on GitHub
- [ ] Added topics/tags (react-native, expo, firebase, typescript)
- [ ] Decided on a license (if making public)
